                            <div class="ml-4 mb-4">
                                <p class="mb-2">After conducting the interviews, our team then spent time transcribing these into scripts to allow us to analyze the data effectively. We then went ahead to break these scripts into sentences and then broke these sentences down further to allow us to get reasonable data about issues these participants were facing and comment about the existing systems that are currently in place. </p>

                                <p class="title font-weight-medium mb-1">Affinity Notes</p>
                                <p class="mb-3">We then proceeded on writing these analyzed data on the post-it notes (Affinity notes) and then put everything on the board as part of the first initial grouping (which was a more general grouping).</p>

                                <p class="title font-weight-medium mb-1">Bottom Level Labels (Blue labels)</p>
                                <p class="mb-3">We proceeded on putting general ideas together and putting these general ideas under a common category by identifying points that were common with some of our interview participants. This gave us a basic understanding of the demographic data. We used the blue post-it notes to identify this group.</p>

                                <p class="title font-weight-medium mb-1">Temporary Top Level Labels (Green labels)</p>
                                <p class="mb-3">For the temporary top level, we had grouped the bottom level into a more broader and common idea category and created temporary category grouping which we had put in the temporary green post-it note. This allowed us to identify relationships between the bottom level groups.</p>

                                <p class="title font-weight-medium mb-1">Middle Level Labels (Pink labels)</p>
                                <p class="mb-3">The Middle level was about bringing the temporary top-level grouping into a more organized and descriptive grouping that allowed us to get a better understanding of the user's needs.</p>

                                <p class="title font-weight-medium mb-1">Top Level Labels (Green labels)</p>
                                <p class="mb-3">For the final step of the interpretation, we used the green post-it note to combine the ideas gotten from the grouping done on the middle level above. This gave a more specific description of what the users wanted and the general solution we should focus on.</p>

                                            Yang Zheng is a graduate student from China. He worked as a software developer 
                                            before coming to RIT for his master’s degree. He really appreciates well documented 
                                            information and finds too many emails annoying. He has applied filters to sift 
                                            through the hoard of emails to just get the important ones and because of this he 
                                            sometimes misses important information which gets filtered out. He regularly visits 
                                            the RIT website and finds it easy to navigate.
